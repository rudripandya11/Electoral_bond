# Electoral Bond Analysis with Pandas in Python
Description: This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (electoral_bond_analysis.ipynb) that utilizes pandas in Python to explore and analyze electoral bond data in India. The notebook delves into various aspects of electoral bonds, including:
<br>
**Data Exploration:-**<br>
Loading and cleaning the electoral bond dataset using pandas functions.
Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of key variables.
Visualizations (charts and graphs) to uncover patterns and trends.
<br>
**Bond Denominations:-**
Analyzing the popularity of different bond denominations (₹1000, ₹10000, etc.).
Identifying potential trends in denomination usage over time.
<br>
**Redemption Patterns:-**
Examining trends in bond redemption by political parties (if data allows).
Exploring potential correlations between denominations and redemption rates.
